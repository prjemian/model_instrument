Configure logging for this session.

There are many _loggers_ to control the level of detailed logging for some
bluesky/ophyd internals.  The next table shows some of the many possible logger
names.  Configure the ``ACTIVATE_LOGGERS`` dictionary (below, where the keys are
logger names and the values are logging level, as shown) with any of these
names, or others which you may find useful:

==========================  ====================================================
logger name                 description
==========================  ====================================================
``bluesky``                 logger to which all bluesky log records propagate
``bluesky.emit_document``   when a Document is emitted. The log record does not contain the full content of the Document.
``bluesky.RE``              Records from a RunEngine. INFO-level notes state changes. DEBUG-level notes when each message from a plan is about to be processed and when a status object has completed.
``bluesky.RE.msg``          when each ``Msg`` is about to be processed.
``bluesky.RE.state``        when the RunEngineâ€™s state changes.
``databroker``              logger to which all databroker log records propagate
``ophyd``                   logger to which all ophyd log records propagate
``ophyd.objects``           records from all devices and signals (that is, OphydObject subclasses)
``ophyd.control_layer``     requests issued to the underlying control layer (e.g. pyepics, caproto)
``ophyd.event_dispatcher``  regular summaries of the backlog of updates from the control layer that are being processed on background threads
==========================  ====================================================
